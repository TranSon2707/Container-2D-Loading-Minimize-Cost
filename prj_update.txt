# IDEA:
- to calculate the minimum area needed and add up the trucks to instantiate a semi-optimal solution and use it as a bound, using branch and bound to find an optimal solution


# PROGRESS:
- made class for Truck and Item


# WHAT TO DO:
- find out about the import library used for solving this problem (because the dudes who made this thing before us used pywraplp/ortools.linear_solver)


# NOTE
- skeptical about whether this would work...
